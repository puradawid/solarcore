SolarCore
---------

Raspberry or other GPIO opensorce system for managing and logging solar installation (for water heating system).

Devices
-------

SolarCore assume some installed devices like:

- digital thermometer DS18B20
- water pump (connected into solar heater -> water tank circuit)

Why opensource?
---------------

There are a lot of systems for it. But no one want to share own
embedded software. So you can by cheap and home-maded solar system
heat your water. It is more ecological than heating by fire ;)

Have fun.

Development
-----------

I do not have a lot of time - i have to make many to live, like anyone else. I will be happy if someone want to develop this source with me. Please fork and have fun.
